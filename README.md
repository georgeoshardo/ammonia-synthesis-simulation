# ammonia-synthesis-simulation
Code I wrote which simulates an ammonia synthesis reactor by solving ODE system for flow, shell&amp;tube heat transfer, pressure, and chemical kinetics 

I wrote this code when I was new to MATLAB and so declared many global variables. This is bad but I cannot be bothered to fix it as there's no point.
